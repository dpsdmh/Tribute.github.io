            Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (/ˈɑːbdəl kəˈlɑːm/ (listen); 15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an
            Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and
            raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four
            decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development
            Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's
            civilian space programme and military missile development efforts. He thus came to be known as the 'Missile
            Man of India' for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also
            played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998,
            the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.

            Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya
            Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's
            President", he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single term.
            He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian
            honour.

            While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an
            apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83. Thousands, including national-level dignitaries, attended
            the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state honours.

        <summary class="para">
            Although Kalam had average grades in school, he was very hard working and had an immense desire to learn. He
            spent a lot of time studying and had developed a particular interest in mathematics. Kalam left Schwartz
            higher secondary school after completing his early education and went to Saint Joseph's College,
            Tiruchirapalli. From Saint Joseph's College, he graduated in physics in 1954. He moved to Madras in 1955 to
            study aerospace engineering at Madras Institute of Technology.

        <div class="topic">Kalam as a Scientist:</div>
        <summary class="para">
            Kalam joined as a scientist in the aeronautical development establishment of DRDO in 1960, after graduation.
            His career started with him designing a small hovercraft. However, he was not convinced by his choice of a
            job at the DRDO. Kalam was transferred to ISRO in 1969, where he was the project director of India's first
            satellite vehicle launch. The satellite vehicle deployed the Rohini satellite successfully in near-Earth
            orbit in July 1980. Kalam received the Government's LV and Slv projects between the 1970s-90s. He directed
            two projects like Project Devil and Project Valiant, which aimed at developing ballistic missiles from the
            successful SLV program's technology Kalam somehow convinced Indira Gandhi and sought secret funds for these
            aerospace projects. His research and immense knowledge brought him and the nation great laurels in the
            1980s.
            Kalam then went on to become the scientific advisor of the defence minister in 1992 and served at the same
            post for five years before getting promoted to the post of principal scientific advisor to the government.
            His immense role in the country's 1998 nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear power. Kamal had
            now become a national hero, to be remembered for ages to come. However, the tests he conducted caused a huge
            uproar in the international community. Kamal put forward a nationwide plan called Technology Vision 2020,
            which according to him, was a fantastic way for transforming the stature of India in 20 years, taking it
            from a developing to a developed nation. The plan envisioned the progress of the nation by adopting advanced
            technology, expanding healthcare facilities, and emphasizing the education of the masses.
